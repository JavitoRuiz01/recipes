<ol><strong>How to Make Lasagna</strong></p>
</ol><ol>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole.</p>
</ol><ol><strong>Here's the run-down:</strong> Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p>
</ol><ol><strong>Let this simmer</strong> while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p>
</ol><ol><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p>
</ol><ol><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat.</strong></pl>
