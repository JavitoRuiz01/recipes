<h2>Ingredient Checklist </h2>
<ul>1 cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons sugar</ul>
<ul>2 teaspoons baking powder</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>1 cup milk</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, or vegetable oil</ul>
<ul>1 large egg</ul>
<ul>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</ul>
<ul>Assorted toppings, such as butter, maple syrup, confectioners' sugar, honey, jams, preserves, sweetened whipped cream, or chocolate syrup</ul>
<h2>Instructions Checklist</h2>
<p>&gt;</p><strong>Step 1</strong>
<ol>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</ol>
<strong>Step 2 </strong>
<ol>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).</ol>
<strong>Step 3</strong>
<ol>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.</ol>
<strong>Step 4 </strong>
<ol>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</ol><strong>Step 5</strong>
<ol>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.</ol>
