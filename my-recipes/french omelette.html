<p><strong>Steps to follow. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Beat Eggs</strong></p>
<p>Begin by cracking three large eggs into a mixing bowl, season them with salt and pepper, and, using the same fork you'll use to cook the omelette, beat the eggs just until no traces of visible white remain.</p>
<p>The old-school wisdom was to add the salt only at the last minute, because the belief was that salt thins eggs, making them watery. The truth, though, is that salt actually helps eggs retain moisture. Pre-salted eggs take on a translucent appearance that can suggest wateriness, but they cook up anything but. (You can read up on our tests with salted eggs here.)</p>
<p>The overall effect is subtle, so it's not worth beating your eggs way in advance, but you also don't need to be afraid if they end up sitting with salt for several minutes. Nothing bad will happen.</p>
<p>As for the pepper, if appearance is truly important to you, go for white, since you'll see it less in the finished omelette. Otherwise, there's really nothing wrong with black.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Heat Pan, Melt Butter, Add Eggs, and Stir</strong></p>
<p>According to the classic technique, you should use high heat for the entire cooking process, in order to set the egg very rapidly. The benefit, if you get the technique right, is that you can form a very thin skin of cooked egg, with a bigger core of soft-scrambled eggs within. Plus, in restaurants, high heat translates to high speed, which is invaluable during a busy service. I suspect high heat was also traditionally used because carbon steel pans are not quite as nonstick as modern nonstick pans; high heat would help the egg set before it bonded with the metal.</p>
<p>In practice, though, especially for home cooks, working with high heat just makes the process more stressful than it needs to be. Moderate heat slows down the cooking, giving you more time to scramble the eggs and some breathing room to get it right.</p>
<p>You may end up with a slightly thicker exterior of cooked egg, but I actually prefer the way it gracefully transitions to a perfectly cooked, soft, and creamy center. Too often, the high-heat method produces a center that still has an unappetizing dose of uncooked egg. (I've even seen respected chefs make omelettes that exude raw yellow liquid onto the plate.)</p>
<p>Moderate heat also reduces the chances that your omelette will prematurely brown once you stop stirring, which isn't nearly as easy when the heat is cranked and the pan is ripping-hot.</p>
<p>To do it, set your pan over moderate heat and melt a tablespoon or so of butter in it, swirling constantly. When the butter is fully melted and foamy, it's hot enough. Now add the egg to the pan.</p>
<p>Take the fork now, and, with its tines up, start stirring quickly, working it all over the pan to break up large curds that form on the bottom. Simultaneously shaking the pan back and forth with your other hand helps keep the egg in motion while you stir&mdash;the more the egg moves around in the pan, the more evenly it cooks.</p>
<p>This part of the process really is just like softly scrambling eggs. In fact, I've come to think of an omelette as something like a scrambled-egg pancake: You scramble the eggs just enough that they get creamy and custardy, but stop when they're still loose enough to fuse into a solid sheet on the bottom. The key is to not scramble them to the point of forming separate curds that will never come back together again.</p>
<p>Learning to find that sweet spot of doneness is the single most important skill in omelette-making; it may take a few practice runs before you get a good feel for it, but it's something anyone can learn. This is a case in which folks with gas flames have a distinct advantage over those with electric-coil or induction cooktops, as a gas flame will heat around the sides of the pan as well, making it easier to get a clean, well-defined edge to your eggs.</p>
<p>As soon as you've hit that perfect point, stop scrambling and use your fork to smooth the egg out and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. You can even give the pan a few taps against the cooktop to help settle it all down, running the fork around the edge to loosen up the lips of the omelette. Some chefs like to tilt the pan while the eggs are still quite runny, letting the bulk of the egg collect in the bottom curve of the pan, which creates a more extreme contrast between the set edge and the very soft center.</p>
<p>At this point, if the egg on top of your creamy little pancake looks like it needs to cook a hair more, just let it linger over the flame an extra moment or two. Don't worry yourself too much about browning. While it's true that the platonic French omelette has no trace of browning on its surface, a little bit won't hurt. (Plus, like I said before, that moderate heat will ensure that the omelette doesn't brown too quickly.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:Fold Omelette, Push Toward Edge of Pan, and Close Lip</strong></p>
<p>Next, tilt the pan up by the handle, and, using your fork, roll the omelette down in half over itself. At this point, you can move the pan off the heat, unless you're still trying to cook some of the egg.</p>
<p>This is the part where the pros do the fist-bump on the handle to jump the omelette toward the lower edge of the pan. Feel free to try that if you want (heck, it's fun!), but don't get scared off thinking it's a necessary move. You can just as easily use the fork to wiggle and prod the omelette down into the curve of the pan. A good nonstick finish will make this easy.</p>
<p>Try to push it far enough that the lower lip of the folded omelette juts out of the pan, then use your fork to push it up, closing the omelette.</p>
<p>Step 4: Flip Onto Plate and Adjust if Needed Now push the omelette a little closer to the edge of the tilted pan, let the pan hover directly above a plate, and tip the pan to roll it out. The seam should be on the bottom, and the omelette should be almond- or cigar-shaped.</p>
<p>If it doesn't look quite right, you can always use a couple of forks&mdash;or a clean kitchen towel, laid over the omelette&mdash;to adjust the omelette's shape and position on the plate.</p>
<p>Some folks will brush it with melted butter to make it gleam at this point, but at home, I don't often bother.</p>
<p>If you need to make more omelettes, you can wipe out the pan with a dish towel and immediately repeat with the next one.</p>
